# SC Shortname

No Pointer gestures

# SC Text

All functionality can be operated without requiring precise/timed pointer gestures or multi-pointer gestures.

Note 1: examples of a multi-pointer gesture include two-finger pinch/zoom

Note 2: this requirement applies to web content which interprets pointer gestures (i.e. this does not apply to gestures that are required to operate the user agent or assistive technology) [editorial: needs cross-referencing with SC relating to "Touch with Assistive Technology"]

Pointer inputs: input devices that can target a specific coordinate (or set of coordinates) on a screen, such as a mouse, pen, or touch contact. (modified slightly from https://w3c.github.io/pointerevents/#glossary)

# What Principle and Guideline the SC falls within.

Principle 2, *new* Guideline "Pointer Accessible"

# Description

Understanding: It may not always be possible for users to perform specific gestures (e.g. draw a complex path with their finger on a touchscreen) in a precise and timely manner - they may lack the precision/accuracy/speed. Further, it may not always be possible for users to perform multi-pointer gestures (e.g. a two-finger pinch/zoom, three-finger rotation)

# Techniques

Don't rely solely on pointer gestures that require high precision or specific timings; don't rely on multi-pointer gestures; provide alternatives that do not require gestures (e.g. additional visible controls that perform the same/similar action as a quick flick/swipe) and alternatives that only require a single pointer, rather than multi-pointer.
